### Hi there, my name is Fedor ðŸ‘‹

I'm C/C++ middle developer with 3 year experience, Golang backend developer with 1-2 year experience and junior Python developer with less than year experience. Currently I do backend development, machine learning and low-level stuff: operating systems, programming languages, etc. Also I'm looking for backend and frontend developers for my project connected with platform named Discord.

Most interesting and active repos in my profile:
- [DepthOS-eps2](https://github.com/FedorLap2006/DepthOS-eps2)
- [Wuvy](https://github.com/FedorLap2006/Wuvy)
- [micro-engine](https://github.com/FedorLap2006/micro-engine)

_If you are wondering why is there so many repos in my profile? - In the past I was looking for some good ideas and created those blank repositories to develop, but didn't continue their development. Most of them inactive, but in the future development of some of them might continue._
