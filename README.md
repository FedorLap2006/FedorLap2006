### Hello there!


I'm Fedor and I'm very excited to meet you in my profile.

I live in Russia and love to develop all sorts of things: website backends, neural networks, bots, operating systems, programming languages and many more! 

I'm the founder of the [Hyperon team](https://github.com/hyperon-team). We currently work on an AI-powered advertisement platform named Hyperia and Discord protection bot named HyperonGuard.

Also I have a lot of experience in all sorts of languages and technologies:
- C/C++ middle level: General, GameDev, Low Level - 3 years
- Golang: Backend - 2 years
- Python: ML, Scripts - 1 year
- Docker - 1 year

Right now I'm learning K8s and practicing on making frontend with React and Vue.

If you wanna get in contact with me, here is some contact information:
- Twitter: [@nitroflap](https://twitter.com/@nitroflap)
- Discord: `lapfed255#4189`

Thanks for your attention.
