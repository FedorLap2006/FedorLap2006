### Hi there, my name is Fedor ðŸ‘‹

I'm C/C++ middle developer with 3 year experience, Golang backend developer with 1-2 year experience and junior Python developer with less than year experience. Currently I'm interested in backend development, machine learning and low-level stuff: operating systems, programming languages, etc. Also I'm looking for backend and frontend developers for my project connected with platform named Discord.

For now, this is mostly interesting and active* repos in my profile:
- [DepthOS-eps2](https://github.com/FedorLap2006/DepthOS-eps2)
- [Wuvy](https://github.com/FedorLap2006/Wuvy)
- [micro-engine](https://github.com/FedorLap2006/micro-engine)

If you are wondering why is there so many repos in my profile? - Don't worry, in the past I was looking for good ideas and created few (well, not just few) blank projects to develop, but *archived* them. So, in near future I may archive them or even hide them until I will have time for develop them.

Thanks for your attention.
Also, my twitter is [@nitroflap](https://twitter.com/@nitroflap) and my discord is `lapfed255#4189`.
