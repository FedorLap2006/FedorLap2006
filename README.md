### Hello there!


I'm Fedor (he/him) and I'm very excited to meet you in my profile.

I love to develop all sorts of things: website backends, neural networks, bots, operating systems, programming languages and many more!

I'm the go-to maintainer of DiscordGo (Discord API bindings for Go) library.

I'm founder of the [Hyperon team](https://github.com/hyperon-team). We're currently working on an AI-powered advertisement platform named Hyperia and Discord server protection bot named HyperonGuard.

Technologies and languages I use:
- C/C++ - 4 years
- Golang - 3 years
- Python (Machine Learning, Scripts) - 2 years
- Docker - 2 years
- React - 1 year
- NextJS - 2 months
- Kubernetes - 2 months
